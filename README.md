# M1805-Final-Project


For my final project I wanted to create a gallery of abstract art through the data of Earthquakes. I included my own photos for the layout of these pages. I'm not exactly well-skilled in p5.js, therefore it took a lot of googling and YouTube and trial and error for this to work. Originally, I had written an entire code of volcanic activity and earthquake data however this ended up being extremely long and unnecessary at times.

First, I declared a variable called timer and set it to 0. I also added a url that points to the USGS earthquake feed in CSV format, and I created placeholders for table and bg so I could load data and a background image later. I wasn't exactly sure how to get this to work though as the images I had wouldn't show up.

Then, in the preload() function, I loaded the background image (grass.png) and the earthquake data table from the URL. I did this here because preload() ensures that assets are ready before the sketch starts running, and in the setup() function, I created a canvas that matches the size of my background image (640 by 382). I also aligned the text to the center and set the text size to 12 so that labels would be readable. I stuggled with this a bit but managed to fix it up. in the draw() function, I started by drawing the background image each frame. I added a timer by checking if the frame count was divisible by 60 (roughly one second at 60 FPS). Each time that condition was true, I incremented the timer. I displayed the timer at the bottom of the canvas in white text. From there I made sure the earthquake data refreshed every 60 seconds. If the timer went above 60, I reloaded the table from the USGS feed and reset the timer back to zero.

After that, I grabbed the number of rows in the table and set starting positions (x = 70, y = 50) for drawing the earthquake data. I looped through each row, pulling out the place and magnitude. I split the place string on “of” so I could display a cleaner location name. For the visualization, I used different colors depending on the magnitude: green for small earthquakes (<2), orange for medium ones (<4), and red for strong ones (≥4). I drew circles (ellipse) sized according to the magnitude, and then I added text labels for the location and magnitude just below each circle.

Finally, I arranged the circles across the canvas. Each time I drew one, I moved x to the right. If x went too far (past the width minus 70), I reset x back to 70 and moved y down by 80, creating a grid-like layout of earthquake data.
